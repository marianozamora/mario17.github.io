            <h5>USALight</h5><b>[in progress]</b>
            <p>USALight.com wanted a responsive site designed to replace their aging 2010 site.  Directive #1 was the creation of a new company logo.  They wanted a logo that kept their flag element, but wanted a design that was more modern.</p>

            <p>This is one of the very few large fully responsive ecommerce sites out there, and is planned to launch on March 20th, 2015.  The company want to keep its current Volusion ecommerce platform along with its homepage 3x3 grid, but wanted the site to scale on laptops, tablets and phones.</p>

            <p>I started by stripping a basic Volusion template down to its bare nuts and bolts, then built the HTML back up to match the design prototype.  Once the design was complete I wrote some Javascript to hide and display the sidebar search filters depending upon the user's location on the site.  Grunt was used for other Javascript tasking in order to optimize the CSS.</p>

            <h5>Union Church</h5><b>[in progress]</b>
            <p>Union Church of Riverside, CA wanted a new site designed from the mobile up with RWD, as their current site does not scale well with tablets.  A monochromatic design was chosen to reflect what was communicated as the seriousness of their mission.  Bootstrap is being used as the framework on which to build this responsive site, and a single page scrolling nav suited their desires for their main content.</p>

            <p>This updated site is not yet published, but is set to go live April 15th, 2015.  I work on it during my own time on nights and weekends.</p>

            <h5>P&amp;R Paper</h5>
            <p>P&amp;R Paper's corporate website needed an update in 2010, and I was happy to give their old site a face lift.  Joomla was chosen as the CMS that they now use to make site updates.  The platform is a bit unforgiving, but I was able to force it to accept the design prototype that carried with it their original color palette.  The logo was recreated in Illustrator since they had no vector source and it needed a freshening.</p>

            <p>I trained their content creator on using the backend in order to add new products, but alas company turnover has put someone new in the position that needs training in order to format the new content correctly.  This will explain some formatting issues with new product lines on the homepage.  This was a freelance side-project.</p>

            <h5>Divorce Shield Advocate Network</h5>
            <p>Divorce Shield Advocate Network was a 2010 startup that needed a corporate site built on the 960 Grid System.  The company is no longer in business, and the site is no longer hosted online.  The header and footer had already been completed, and I was responsible for the design of all the interior content.  I created custom icon sets and 3D image content in order to meet their design specifications.</p>

            <h5>Ballard Plumbing</h5>
            <p>Ballard Plumbing needed a simple site for customers to access their services and contact information.  The owner wanted a site that was easy for novices to update content in, so Weebly was chosen to allow them to easily update their site's content when needed.  The site uses a customized Weebly template.</p>
